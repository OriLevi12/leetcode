"""
Approach: Min-Heap (PriorityQueue)
- Push the head of each non-empty list into a min-heap.
- Repeatedly pop the smallest node, append it to the result list,
  and push its next node into the heap if it exists.
- Continue until the heap is empty.

Time Complexity:  O(N log k)  (N = total nodes, k = number of lists)
Space Complexity: O(k)        (heap holds at most k nodes)
